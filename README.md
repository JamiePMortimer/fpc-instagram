# instagram Clone

Clone site of the instagram login page.

## Project aims

To produce a semi-functional frontpage of instagram to practice and improve HTML, CSS & JS knowledge and skills and to expand knowledge range through the challenges faced in replicating the site.

It is not intended to link to instagram and isn't responsive so should only reliably render on desktops.

### Challenges

Form input animations

```
Having not learned this skill yet, I had to rely heavily on a tutorial by Dev Ed on form animations, while straightforward for the username element, took a little adapting for the 2nd input as the animation wasn't activating
```

Show/Hide button

```
I'd read about the updating of the class elements to get the login buttons to hide or reveal the password, but hadn't applied this myself. The application of the functionality was straightforward enough, although the button drove the submission of the form when used. Resolved this by setting the type to 'button.
```

Image Crossfade

```
The site had an iPhone backround image with a div section with an image carousel. I had to rely heavily on the article below and replicate the code.
